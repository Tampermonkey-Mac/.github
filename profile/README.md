## What is Tampermonkey?  

**Tampermonkey** is a versatile userscript manager that allows you to run custom scripts to enhance or automate web pages directly in Safari. It provides a safe, organized environment for managing scripts that can modify webpage behavior, add new features, or streamline repetitive tasks.  

With Tampermonkey, users can:  

- **Customize Websites:** Modify page layouts, change styling, or hide unwanted elements.  
- **Automate Tasks:** Perform repetitive actions automatically, such as form filling, clicking buttons, or updating content.  
- **Extend Functionality:** Add new tools or features to websites that do not natively support them.  
- **Script Management:** Easily install, enable, disable, or update multiple userscripts from a single interface.  
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** While tailored for Safari, Tampermonkey also supports other browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.  

Tampermonkey is perfect for developers, power users, and anyone looking to take control of their web browsing experience. By combining simplicity with powerful features, it enables customization and automation without compromising security.
